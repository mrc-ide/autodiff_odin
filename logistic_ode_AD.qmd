# Automatic Differentiation

## General principles

- Based on chen et al.
![](images/ode_AD_chen.png)

# Comparison with discrete AD algorithm {.smaller}

very similar algorithm

* Step 1: run the system forward until the last data point
* Step 2: compute the contribution of data point to adjoints
* Step 3: compute the backward system (including state, adjoint state and adjoint parameters) until previous data point or initial time
* Step 4: if not initial time go to step 2, if initial go to step 5
* Step 5: add the contribution of initial conditions to adjoint of parameters
* Step 6: read gradient


# Worked example: logistic function

## About the logistic function

- Simple ode modelling growth with saturation
- Analytic solution
- Non linear
